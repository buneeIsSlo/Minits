## üåà Inspiration

I follow the Pomodoro technique and it has been instrumental in helping me manage my time and stay focused on my work.
I also enjoy listening to ambient music while I work, so I realized that developing a Pomodoro timer that integrates my preferred music would be a great way to make my work more enjoyable and productive.
